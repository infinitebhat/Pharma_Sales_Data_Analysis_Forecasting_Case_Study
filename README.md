# Pharma_Sales_Data_Analysis_Forecasting_Case_Study
The objective of the research behind the paper was to validate different methods and approaches related to sales time series data preparation, analysis and forecasting, with aim to facilitate recommending sales and marketing strategies based on trend/seasonality effects and forecasting sales of eight different groups of pharmaceutical products with diverse characteristics, such as stationarity, seasonality, amount of residuals and sales data variance. All these analyses and forecasts are made on a small scale, for a single distributor, pharmacy chain or even individual pharmacy. Paper presents only research work related to univariate time series analysis, while potential candidates for explanatory input variables were also identified and shortly elaborated. Effectiveness of three forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Facebookâ€™s Prophet and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks was investigated. Each of the method is complemented with two optimization and validation approaches, relevant for short-term (so called rolling forecast scenario) and long-term forecasting.
